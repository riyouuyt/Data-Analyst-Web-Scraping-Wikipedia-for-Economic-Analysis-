# Data Analyst: Web Scraping Wikipedia for Economic Analysis
This repository contains a data analysis project focused on web scraping data from Wikipedia for economic analysis purposes. The project aims to extract relevant economic data from Wikipedia pages of different countries and perform analysis on various economic indicators.

## Project Overview
The main objectives of this project are as follows:

1. Web scrape economic data from Wikipedia pages of different countries:
2. In this step, the project focuses on web scraping relevant economic data from Wikipedia pages. The specific Wikipedia pages for different countries are identified, and the necessary data is extracted using web scraping techniques.

3. Perform data preprocessing to clean and prepare the scraped data:
4. After obtaining the data from Wikipedia, it is essential to preprocess the data to ensure its quality and suitability for analysis. This step involves handling missing values, data formatting, data type conversions, and any other necessary data cleaning operations.

5. Analyze and compare economic indicators across countries:
6. Once the data is preprocessed, the project moves on to analyzing the economic indicators. This step involves performing various analytical techniques, calculations, and statistical operations to gain insights into the economic performance of different countries.

7. Visualize the data using appropriate plots and charts:
8. To effectively communicate the analysis results, data visualization plays a crucial role. This step focuses on creating visual representations such as line plots, bar charts, or scatter plots to showcase the patterns, trends, and comparisons in the economic data.

9. Provide insights and conclusions based on the analysis:
10. The final step of the project is to draw meaningful insights and conclusions from the analysis. Based on the patterns and trends identified in the data and the comparative analysis performed, the project aims to provide valuable insights and make informed conclusions about the economic performance of different countries.
